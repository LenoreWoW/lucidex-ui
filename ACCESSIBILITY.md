## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

#### Using Accessibility Utilities
```typescript
import {
  announceToScreenReader,
  manageFocusForRouteChange,
  createAriaLabel,
  KeyCodes
} from '@/lib/accessibility';

// Announce changes to screen readers
announceToScreenReader('Component updated successfully', 'polite');

// Manage focus for route changes
manageFocusForRouteChange('h1');

// Create proper ARIA labels
const ariaProps = createAriaLabel('Save document', 'Saves the current document to your account');
```

#### Using Accessibility Hooks
```typescript
import {
  useFocusTrap,
  useKeyboardNavigation,
  useEscapeKey
} from '@/hooks/useAccessibility';

// Focus trapping for modals
const modalRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
useFocusTrap(isModalOpen, modalRef);

// Keyboard navigation for lists
const navigation = useKeyboardNavigation(menuItems, 'vertical', true);

// Escape key handling
useEscapeKey(closeModal, isModalOpen);
```

### For Content Creators

#### Writing Accessible Content
- **Use descriptive headings** that clearly indicate content structure
- **Write meaningful link text** that makes sense out of context
- **Provide alternative text** for images that conveys the same information
- **Use clear, simple language** avoiding jargon when possible

#### Form Best Practices
- **Label all form controls** clearly and descriptively
- **Group related form controls** using fieldsets and legends
- **Provide clear validation messages** with specific correction guidance
- **Indicate required fields** both visually and programmatically

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing
- **Built-in Audit Tool**: Use the accessibility checker for immediate feedback
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated accessibility checks in development pipeline
- **Color Contrast Validation**: Real-time contrast checking tools

### Manual Testing
1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Test all functionality using only keyboard
2. **Screen Reader Testing**: Use NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver to test content
3. **High Contrast Mode**: Test visibility in high contrast display modes
4. **Reduced Motion**: Verify functionality with reduced motion preferences
